## 👻✨ **Haunted By Code** 🌌🪐  
Welcome, Brave Coder! You’ve stumbled into **Haunted By Code** — a realm where ghostly bugs whisper secrets, black holes hide Easter eggs, and lines of code travel faster than light (or at least try to 👽).
"paranomal Codes: Phantom Scripts & Cursed Commits”

## 🕸️ **About Me** 🧙‍♀️  
Hey, fellow explorer of the unknown! 

I’m an aspiring AIML engineer currently exploring AI & ML through real-world projects and internships.I’m the kind of developer who’d rather summon spirits in the terminal than run from creaking doors at midnight. 

This is my haunted lab, where adventure, paranormal glitches, and cosmic curiosity collide into weird, wonderful projects.

📽️ **Presentations** — Slides that haunt minds long after the lights go out

## 💀 **What Haunts This Repo**

✨ Cursed-but-clean mini projects  

🔮 Presentation tools & slide sorcery  

👂 Bots that listen in the void  

🕷️ Eerie but well-commented code (mostly — the ghosts edit when I sleep)

## 🕷️ **Codecraft & Shadows 🌙👻”?**

- Debugging at 3 AM is basically ghost hunting 👻
 
- Black holes are easier to explain than unhandled exceptions 🕳️
 
- And coding is my trusty exorcism ritual 🧹
